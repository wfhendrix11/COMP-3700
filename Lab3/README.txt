To compile use: "c++ wfh0008_3.cpp"
to run use: "./a.out"

In the typescript file I showed the program worked using the "Maze_1.txt" file first. I also showed
my program reading each file we were given, and createing the graph and printing it all out.

If you want to do this yourself, change the file name in line 96 of "Maze.cpp" and uncomment lines 216 - 219.

This will show you that the program reads all the files correctly and creates a graph correctly. 

Thank you!
