# Software-Construction
COMP 2710 - Software Construction

Projects from my COMP 2710 class. Projects were written using a text editor(Sublime), and remote accessing Linux computers on the Auburn
University main campus, directions for which can be found here, http://www.eng.auburn.edu/ens/helpdesk/off-campus/access-information.html
We used SecureCRT as the terminal emulator, which can be found here: https://www.vandyke.com/products/securecrt/
and WinSCP as the file transfer client, which can be found here: https://winscp.net/eng/download.php

All projects were compiled using the linux C++ compiler.
